# Factory Pattern: 

_A creational design pattern in Java that has a method that returns at runtime one of several possible classes that share a common super class. It allows you to create objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created._

  - It used when you don't know ahead of time what class object you need.
  - When all of the potential classes are in the same subclass hierarchy. 
  - To centralize class selection code. 
  - When you don't want the user to know every subclass.
  - To encapsulate the object creation.
