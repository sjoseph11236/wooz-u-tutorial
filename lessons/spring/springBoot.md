# Spring Boot:

_A spring based Java framework that is used to build stand-alone and production ready spring applications. It used to create micro Services.It handles the configuration needed for spring application to allow developers to code right away._

_Spring Boot automatically configures your application based on the dependencies you have added to the project by using @EnableAutoConfiguration annotation. For example, if MySQL database is on your classpath, but you have not configured any database connection, then Spring Boot auto-configures an in-memory database. The entry point of the spring boot application is the class contains @SpringBootApplication annotation and the main method. Spring Boot automatically scans all the components included in the project by using @ComponentScan annotation._
