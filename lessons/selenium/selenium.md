# Selenium:

_A suite of automation tools for testing web applications on the browser. Selenium consists of the Selenium IDE, Web driver, and Grid and previously RC. These tools help emulate user interaction with browsers._

## WebDriver:

  _The WebDriver is an API and protocol that defines a language-neutral interface for controlling the behavior of web browsers. WebDriver support Java, JavaScript, Ruby, C#, Python. It supports the operation systems such as Windows, Mac OS, Linux and Solaris. The browsers it supports are Chrome 12 or higher, Firefox, Safari, Opera 11 and higher.  It is the successor to Selenium RC. This API provides a way to write and run tests that operate the browser is a real user. Also, the API is separate from application code, so it is not intrusive._

##IDE: 

  _The Integrated Development Environment is tool you use to develop your selenium test cases. It is Chrome and Firefox extension. This records the users action in the browser and converts them to Selenium commands,so it serves as great way to learn Selenium script syntax._

## GRID: 

  _A tool that allows you to run test cases in different machines across different platforms. The tool allows you to run the local defined test case remotely on multiple browsers and operating system combinations._
